```bash
    touch .env
```
- Inside the .env file, add the following:
```bash
    SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
    DEBUG=True
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost
    REDIS_HOST=redis

```
Make sure to replace your-secret-key with an actual secret key.


3. **Build the Docker Images:**:
Build the Docker images by running the following command:
```bash
    docker-compose build
```
This will create the necessary Docker images for your Django app and Redis.

4. **Run the Docker Containers:**:

```
7. **Access the Application:**:
The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your web browser.

# Additional Docker Commands
- Stop the Containers: To stop the containers, run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
- Rebuild the Docker Images (if you change dependencies):
